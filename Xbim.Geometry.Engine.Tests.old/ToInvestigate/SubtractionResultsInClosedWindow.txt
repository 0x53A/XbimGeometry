Notes on the problem:
=====================

File comes from:
https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimGeometry/issues/46

#12756=IFCSHAPEREPRESENTATION(#87,'Body','Brep',(#12752));
Has two window openings embedded in the Brep.

However once the IFCRELVOIDSELEMENT #286492 solid subtraction is performed one of the two openings disappears.

The subtraction results in an addition of volume.

A warning sign might be that the volume of the BREP is 0.

Geometry functions for IfcFacetedBrep #12752 succeed but the volume is always 0.
