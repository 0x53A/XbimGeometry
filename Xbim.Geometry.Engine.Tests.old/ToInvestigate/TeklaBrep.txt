Notes on the problem:
=====================

File comes from:
https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimGeometry/issues/47

The geometry has triangles flaring out from one side to the opposite of the thin shell.
Solibri does not show them.

They seem to result from very short segments in the polyloops that are defined by 6 points at each end of the shape (e.g. 119019).

Removing colinear points in the surface fixes the problem.
