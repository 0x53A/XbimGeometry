Bounding Sphere
	Indicator of size, does not consider shape proportion and mass
Number of Planar faces
	Indicator of Shape complexity or detail, potential curvature
Number of Shells
	Indicator Complexity of materials and manufacture
Surface Area
	Approximates to shape mass
Distribution of Normals (Matrix density)
	Indicator of curvature of shape
Sum of Surface Areas for each discrete normal (sum of normals)
	Indicator of shape and proportion
Percentage of planar faces
	
	
Bounding Box
	Slightly better indicator of shape proportion and mass than bounding sphere
Number of Triangles
	Similar indicator to planar faces
Number of Vertices
	Indicator of Complexity of detail, proportional to planar faces	
Number of Edges
	Angularity
